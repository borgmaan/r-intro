Such a short tutorial cannot cover the vast *R* universe in much detail. Fortunately, one of the greatest things about *R* is the vibrant community supporting it. One can find endless tutorials, books, presentations, etc. on just about any aspect of *R* you want -- from beginner topics to advances matters. Once you have some familiarity with *R*, you'll be able to "Google your way out" of most problems you run into. Here's a small list of useful resources:

* [RStudio provides many online learning resources](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/)
* [And even more helpful links buried in an RStudio wiki page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552336-Getting-Help-with-R)
* [Code School has an excellent tutorial to help you get acquainted with R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) 
* [StackOverflow is a great place to find answers to R programming questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
* [Google Developers intro to R video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffR3fWv4xw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP)
* [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
	- The first few sections are excellent for beginners
	- The rest of the book is essential for a deep understanding of *R*

# Brief Intro To RStudio & *R* Concepts

### The *R* Console

*R* was initially developed to be an *interactive* computing language -- meaning users manually enter commands into an *R* *console* to produce a result. Interactive computing is a great way to investigate data sets and perform [exploratory data analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis). This is one of the main reasons for *R*'s popularity in the scientific community. 

RStudio has an *R* console running inside it:

### *R* Calculator

In it's most basic form, the *R* console can be used as a glorified calculator. Enter the following commands into your *R* console to see it in action.

```{r}
2+2
5*4
2^3
```

It is also smart enough to understand order of operations:

```{r}
2+3*4/(5+3)*15/2^2+3*4^2
```
But *R* can be much more than just a calculator... :)


### R Objects

Here, we'll cover some of the basics related to using R objects. Everything that exists in *R* is known as an object. Don't worry too much about what that means for now. Focus on learning how to use *R* objects. 

#### Assignment

Objects in *R* are assigned to **variables**. Variables allow us to name *things* we're using in our *R* computations so they may be easily accessed and manipulated later. 

Here's an example of assigning the number `3` to the variable name `x`:

```{r}
x <- 3
```

`<-` is known as the assignment operator in `R`. The code chunk above would be read "x is assigned the value of three". When you type the name of a variable that has been assigned a value, *R* will typically print the assigned value:

```
> x <- 3
> x
[1] 3
```

If you type the name of an object that does not exist, you will get an error

```
> y
Error: object 'y' not found
```

You can name your variables anything you want, but there are a few rules:

1. Names may contain letters, numbers or periods, and the underscore character
2. Names must start with a letter or period. 
3. `v.one` and `v_one` are valid names but `v one` is not (because it includes a space).

More information on general *R* programming style can be found [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).


#### R Data Structures

An excellent comprehensive overview of the types of objects used to store data in *R* can be found [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html). We'll briefly cover these below


### The R Workspace

The *R* workspace can be thought of as a container holding all of the objects you've created duing your *R* session. You can print a list of all of the objects in your current workspace using the `ls()` function. If we start a new *R* session, our workspace will be empty:

```
> ls()
character(0)
```

And we'll be able to see some objects if we add them:

```
> x <- 20
> y <- 30
> z <- x + y
> ls()
[1] "x" "y" "z"
```




### R Packages

Packages are what make *R* so great. Packages allow *R* users to develop and **share** new code to extend the language -- e.g. implementing a new statistical model for analyzing microarrays, creating an awesome new graph to show copy number alterations in tumor samples, etc. *R* has become the *lingua franca* for statisticians developing new statistical techniques and has been widely adopted in the bioinformatics community ([Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/)).

#### CRAN

Most generic *R* packages are hosted on the Comprehensive *R* Archive Network [CRAN](http://cran.us.r-project.org/). To install one of these packages, you would use `install.packages("packagename")`. You only need to install a package once, then load it each time using `library(packagename)`. Here's how one would install and load the `ggplot2` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install only once.
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load the package every time you want to use it.
library(ggplot2)
```
